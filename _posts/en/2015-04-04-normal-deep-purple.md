## Paragraphs

This is a short paragraph.

And this is a paragraph with way more words. I'll just type a few things. Well,
I don't know what to say. This is difficult. Almost finished with second line...
Yay! I did it! Let's see if I can get to the forth line. Almost here, I can feel
IT, yeah!!! I just drank some water. There is a reason why I took the first
chapters from Quixote to fill content. This is really hard. I've been writing
this for 6 minutes now. Maybe 3 more lines and I'll stop. I wonder if the
paragraph is long enough. It better be, I'm suffering with this situation. I'll
just finish talking about my commute. I take three trains to get to work and I
have to walk to the first. Normally it takes about an hour. Really weird people
in the morning train. When someone is really weird I usually talk about it on
Twitter.

## Notes

Long note:

> Long note: Well, here we are again. This time I'll put less words. A few lines
will be enough. This time I'll talk about the commute back home. And yes, it is
three trains again. But it takes more times because they come less often.
